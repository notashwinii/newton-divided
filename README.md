# Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation

This project is an application for performing Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation. It allows users to input data points, calculate interpolated values at specific points, and visualize the interpolation on a graph. 

## Requirements

Python 3.7 or later


## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/notashwinii/newton-divided.git
   cd newton-divided
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Run

1. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python interpolation.py
   ```

2. The application window will open, and you can start using it.

## How to Use the Application

1. **Adding Points**:
   - Enter the x-coordinate and y-coordinate in the respective input fields under the "Input Data" section.
   - Click the "Add Point" button to add the point.
   - The added points will be displayed in the text area.

2. **Calculating Interpolation**:
   - Enter the x-coordinate where you want to calculate the interpolated value under the "Interpolation" section.
   - Click the "Calculate" button to compute the interpolated value.
   - The result will be displayed in the "Result" field.

3. **Visualizing the Interpolation**:
   - The graph on the right will automatically update with the points and the interpolation curve.
   - If an interpolated point is calculated, it will be highlighted in red.
